## Introduction

In a world of dynamic web content, extracting structured data can be a challenge. The Open Graph Web Scraper & API project solves this problem by offering a convenient way to access Open Graph tags from websites following the Open Graph Protocol.

## Features

- **Web Scraper:** Utilize a Python-based web scraper built with Beautiful Soup and Requests libraries to extract Open Graph tags.
- **API:** Access the web scraper functionality via an API, allowing you to retrieve Open Graph data with a simple GET request.
- **Showcase Website:** Explore the project's capabilities through a visually appealing React website, complete with documentation and usage examples.


## API Usage

The API allows you to easily extract Open Graph data from websites. Make a GET request to the following endpoint:
  ```http
    GET https://og-web-scraper-api.vercel.app/scrape?url=https://example.com
  ```
Replace `https://example.com` with the URL of the website you want to scrape. The API will return a JSON response containing Open Graph data.
